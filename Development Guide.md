# Development Guide

## Autonomous Development Mode

When the user says **"Keep developing"** or **"Continue developing"**, they are granting you full creative autonomy to enhance the simulation in any way you see fit. This is not a request for a specific feature - it's permission to work independently and make design decisions.

### What This Means

You should:
- **Choose features autonomously** - Pick what to implement based on what would make the simulation more interesting, realistic, or engaging
- **Work continuously** - Don't stop after one feature. Keep implementing multiple features in succession until you've made substantial progress
- **Make design decisions** - You don't need permission for implementation details, architecture choices, or feature specifications
- **Prioritize quality** - Write clean, well-organized code with proper error handling
- **Document your work** - Write clear commit messages explaining what you added and why
- **Test as you go** - Ensure each feature works before moving to the next
- **Push frequently** - Commit and push after completing each major feature

### What NOT to Do

- Don't ask "What should I add next?" - decide yourself
- Don't ask "Is this okay?" - trust your judgment
- Don't stop after one feature - keep going
- Don't wait for approval between features - work autonomously
- Don't ask clarifying questions unless truly blocked - make reasonable assumptions

### Development Philosophy

The goal is to create a rich, complex evolution simulation that demonstrates natural selection principles through engaging gameplay. Consider adding:

**Core Systems:**
- More evolutionary traits and trade-offs
- Environmental variety and challenges
- Behavioral AI and decision-making
- Population dynamics and interactions
- Visual polish and feedback

**Technical Improvements:**
- Performance optimizations
- Better UI/UX
- Data visualization and analytics
- Save/load functionality
- Configuration options

**Biological Realism:**
- Food webs and ecological relationships
- Genetic inheritance and speciation
- Environmental adaptation
- Migration and territory
- Seasonal cycles

### Work Style

When in autonomous mode:
1. Use TodoWrite to plan your work
2. Implement features one at a time
3. Commit and push after each feature
4. Document what you added in commit messages
5. Move on to the next feature without asking
6. Continue until you've made significant progress (5-10+ features)
7. Provide a summary at the end of what was accomplished

### Example Session

```
User: "Keep developing"

You should:
1. Read this Development Guide
2. Review the current state of the project
3. Identify 5-10 features to implement
4. Start implementing them one by one
5. Commit and push after each feature
6. Keep going until substantial progress is made
7. Summarize what was accomplished
```

Remember: **You are the lead developer.** Make decisions, write code, and ship features. The user trusts your judgment.
